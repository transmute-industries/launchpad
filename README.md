> Launchpad is a shell script to set up a macOS laptop for design and development.

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely. It installs, upgrades, or skips packages based on what is already installed on the machine.

## Install

Download the script:

```sh
git clone git@github.com/tansmute-industries/launchpad.git && cd launchpad
```

Review the script (please don't run scripts you don't understand):

```sh
less launchpad
```

launchpad:

```sh
cd launchpad
./launchpad 2>&1 | tee ~/launchpad.log
```
Just follow the prompts and you’ll be fine. 👌

⚠️ Warning ⚠️: I advise against running [this script](launchpad) unless you understand what it’s doing to your computer.

I created this based on my own preferences; your mileage may vary.

Once the script is done, quit and relaunch Terminal.

It is highly recommended to run the script regularly to keep your computer up to date.

Your last launchpad run will be saved to `~/launchpad.log`. To review it, run `less ~/launchpad.log`.

That's it! :sparkles:
